This project encompasses both the Firefox Extension and the Chrome Extension

Do not edit any files with ï¿½ (&sup2; or superscript two) through the browser, it will screw them up.



Right now there are problems with addition/subtraction. Working on a new engine that instead of using eval() only, will run the whole thing through some regex that will add/subtract everything before it runs an eval to do the multiplication/division.

Also, working on a new version for FF 4. As of FF 4 this will no longer go in the Status-Bar so it's kind of pointless to call this extension the "Status-bar Calculator" except for the brand-recognition...
